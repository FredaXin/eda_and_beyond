# EDA and Beyond - Python library for automating common procedures in machine learning and data science

Author: Freda Xin

## Objective  

The aim of this library is to build a collection of automation tools for some common procedures in machine
learning and data science.   


**Open-Source**   
As someone who has benefitted immensely from the robust open-source communities, I
would like to do my part to contribute. This library is still at its early
stage, and I would like to invite any like-minded
people to collaborate and further advance this project. Please do not hesitate to reach out or
submit a pull request. :)
