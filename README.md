## Project Description 
The library provides a collection of automation tools for some common procedures
in machine learning. The current version aims to streamline the EDA and modeling
process for [Scikit-Learn models](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). 


The library consists of two modules: 
* [eda_tools](https://github.com/FredaXin/eda_and_beyond/blob/master/eda_and_beyond/eda_tools.py):
  provides functions to automate common procedures in EDA, model
    preparation, and data visualization etc. 

* [modeling_tools](https://github.com/FredaXin/eda_and_beyond/blob/master/eda_and_beyond/modeling_tools.py):
  provides a class object that includes methods to streamline the
    modeling process for Scikit-Learn models. 
 
This is a open-source project. Contributors are welcome. :)
