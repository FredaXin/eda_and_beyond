## Objective  

The aim of this library is to build a collection of automation tools for some common procedures in machine
learning and data science.   

The library currently consists of two parts: 
* [EDA
tools](https://github.com/FredaXin/eda_and_beyond/blob/master/eda_and_beyond/eda_tools.py)
 

* [Modeling
Tools](https://github.com/FredaXin/eda_and_beyond/blob/master/eda_and_beyond/modeling_tools.py)
 


As someone who has benefitted immensely from the robust open-source communities, I
would like to do my part to contribute. This library is still at its early
stage, and I would like to invite any like-minded
people to collaborate and further advance this project. Please do not hesitate to reach out or
submit a pull request. :)
